# cat_dog_classification
A model to classify if the image is of a dog or of a cat
There are 3 models being built  
  1) Convolutional Neural Network with 1 hidden layers
  2) Convolutional Neural Network with 3 hidden layers
  3) Convolutional Neural Network with transfer learning
 
Experimentation is done with the number of epochs and accuracy and loss is plooted to see how well the model is performing
